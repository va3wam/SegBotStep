# SegbotSTEP
This project has the goal of creating a balancing two-wheeled robot with stepper motors using the Arduino development ecosystem.  

## Getting Started
To participate in this project you will require a SegbotSTEP robot chassis. A document detailing this will be placed in the repository at a later date. 

This code was developed using the Arduino IDE, version Starting with 1.8.2 for the Adafruit Huzzah Featherboard. You will need to install this boards platform packages using the Arduino Boards Manager. You will also have to remove the pre-loaded NodeMCU's Lua interpreter. Instructions to do this are provided by Adafruit [https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-huzzah-esp8266-breakout/using-arduino-ide].
